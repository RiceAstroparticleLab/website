            <p class="lead"><p>The Rice University astroparticle group has an opening for a postdoctoral researcher to participate in the XENON collaboration as a computational astroparticle physicist, where the intended task is to work on software infrastructure and methods for the XENONnT dark matter experiment. We have a history of working on experimental software stacks for dark matter and neutrino experiments, where this position will partially work in this realm. Examples of the work we have done, which ranges from acquisition, to signal processing, to reconstruction, to analysis software, is available on Github under the XENON1T, XENONnT, and AxFoundation projects. The postdoc would work with others to identify places to innovate while still helping maintain the software stack. We pride ourselves on being on the forefront of using Big Data technologies and the Scientific Python Stack to develop simple sophisticated systems to get the most physics out of the detector as possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have extensive experience in data analysis for these detectors. The postdoc will be expected to produce academic output in the form of papers, talks, or proceedings, where this would be a mix of the physics path or the cyberinfrastructure path. Specifically, having the former analysis coordinator, there is extensive knowledge in commissioning analysis, spin-independent dark matter searches, and low-mass searches. The postdoc ideally will contribute to the initial analysis of the XENONnT detector given the proximity of this software work to the analysis. Furthermore, as this postdoc arises from the Rice Data Science Initiative, the postdoc would be encouraged to collaborate more widely within Rice to identify techniques in other fields (e.g. machine learning techniques such as manifold learning) that can be impactful within particle physics analysis.</p>
<p>Rice University is located in Houston, Texas, where it is one of the few warm-weathed schools in the top 15 Universities in the USA. As one of the most diverse minority-majority cities in the USA, there is somethinng for everybody. Within the University, the XENON group is one of the founding members and has historically worked on topics such as those related to electric field. More recently, the group has expanded to include the first joint Physics, Astronomy, and Computer Science hire in our field. Within the University, we are building collaborations witht the Statistics Department and Ken Kennedy Institute for Information Technology. In the area, the Houston Medical Center is next to Rice University and the largest of its kind.</p>
<p>Education requirements: Doctorate in physics, astronomy, or related field, or PhD in Computer Science with focus on applications.</p>
<p>Experience and skills required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience developing scientific software, including acquisition, pipeline, reconstruction</li>
<li>Willingness to work in Python and participate in open source software development</li>
<li>Experience with large data sets.</li>
<li>Occasional travel to the Gran Sasso National Park in Central Italy.</li>
<li>Desire to develop methods and solutions more broadly applicable than XENONnT.</li>
<li>Knowledge of statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>Other preferred qualifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge of particle detectors, especially dark matter detectors.</li>
<li>Experience with Scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, numba)</li>
<li>Willingness to learn new tools and software that we use related to data science (MongoDB, RestFUL APIs, AppEngine, S3)</li>
<li>Experience with machine learning tools</li>
<li>Experience with JavaScript (e.g. NodeJS)</li>
<li>Willingness to take a leadership role with small teams to explore new technologies of interest to particle physics, and the subsequent refactoring</li>
<li>Experience working in international teams</li>
</ul>
<p>Please direct questions to <a href="tunnell@rice.edu">Prof Christopher Tunnell</a>. If you work on software/cyberinfrastructure in another field and have an already prepared research statement in that field, please be sure to use the cover letter to explain the switch and the broader impacts of your research to potentially XENONnT.</p>
